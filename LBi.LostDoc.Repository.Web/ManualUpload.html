        Sample File Upload Form</h1>
    <p>
        <b>NOTE: This script is <i>not</i> operative on this server. You must install it on
            your own server in order to see it operate.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        This page allows you to upload a file. Note that the script will limit the size
        of the file to around 50k (so that the server doesn't get swamped with data).
    </p>
    <p>
        The file upload form looks just like any other form except that:
        <ol>
            <li>the form tag must specify the <em>POST</em> method</li>
            <li>the form tag must specify an enctype of <em>multipart/form-data</em></li>
            <li>the form must contain an <em>&lt;input type=file&gt;</em> element.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        The processing of a file upload is exactly like that of ordinary data; just make
        a call to <b><tt>ReadParse</b></tt> and the data will either be put in <tt>%in</tt>
        or some other variable that you specify. If you want to write files to disk (rather
        than store the data in memory), then you also need to set the variable <tt>$cgi_lib'writefiles</tt>
        to indicate the directory where the data should be written. Other variables allow
        you to further customize the file upload.
